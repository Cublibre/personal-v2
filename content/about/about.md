When I was little, I made a website on Wix trying to convince my parents to get a pet cat. It didn’t work, but it did begin my fascination with the evolving web. Since then, I’ve learned how to build web apps with Vue.js, React, and Gatsby.

I’ve also [developed a game with my university’s game dev studio](https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/bloom-tome-of-power) and contributed to my [favorite rhythm game on GitHub](https://github.com/ppy/osu). Through my experience, I learned some patterns for scalable and maintainable code while collaborating with the project developers to get new features merged into master.
