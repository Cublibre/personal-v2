Ever since I was little, I've been fascinated by shiny new electronics and video games. I liked making small projects in my middle&high school years like a visual novel with RenPy and a Unity space shooter game. These things inspired me to pursue computer science in college, where I had the opportunity to learn about how the programs I use every day are developed.

In my college years, I started my journey in web dev with a [prototype matchmaking web app for students](https://github.com/Cublibre/spark). I’ve also [developed a game with my university’s game dev studio](https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/bloom-tome-of-power) and contributed to my [favorite rhythm game on GitHub](https://github.com/ppy/osu). Through my experience, I learned some patterns for scalable and maintainable code while collaborating with the project developers to get new features merged into the game.
